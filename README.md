STEM House App Challenge
####

If you are looking for the final source code for the House Student App Challenge, 
please look in the branch entitled StudentAppFinal. This branch will be "locked" (Not pushed to) the second the app is submitted.

The master branch is currently an older version of the final,
but I had to remake the project loosing all the commit history.
Github then thinks it is a completely different project and won't let me merge.

Mutliplayer Request Server URL will be changed from the one in the code as soon as the judges have judged. That code is a php file called bytes.php, for future reference.

Upload it, set the database details, and replace the bytesURL address in AKData.m. If the code is unchanged, it should work right away.
